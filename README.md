Creates boxes with problems numbers for doing bookwork

This was a project I made a while ago. I am just moving it to Github because a friend asked. This was the first (and, as of now, only) flask server that I wrote, so some of the code may be a little bit janky. It was also the first time I was sending HTTP requests from JS, and I do not think I did that correctly. Nonetheless, I still like the idea and use the website when I need to do bookwork.
